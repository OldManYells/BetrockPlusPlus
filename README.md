A from-scratch rewrite/combination of Beta++/Betrock and BetrockServer to combine their bests parts cleanly.

# Goals
A full, from-scratch reimplementation of Minecraft Beta 1.7.3.

1. Ideally BPP should be capable of acting as both a Client and Server
2. Functionality would be extended where desired or necessary, but generally compatibility and faithfulness will be prioritized
3. Cross-platform (Windows and Linux)
4. Fully open-source, anyone can fork, commit and contribute
5. Unless something requires decompiled code for the sake of accuracy, no decompiled code will be used, reimplemented or referenced. If it **is** used for anything, it'll be very clearly marked as such in the code via comments. At most it'll serve as a reference for what not to do, and what pitfalls we should avoid

## Discord
This is another project that's part of/worked on by the OpenBeta Community. We have a [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/JHTz2HSKrf)!

## Contributing
Please read the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/OfficialPixelBrush/BetrockServer/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) page.

## AI policy

Generally, we're perfectly fine with adding code that was created with the help of AI tooling to our codebase.

What we *don't* want are slop-commits that just rewrite stuff for the sake of rewriting it. We don't want or need a 505k line mega-commit that adds 26 new files, that all have duplicated functionality, or breath other parts of the code.

Keep it reasonable, don't overdo it. This is supposed to be a learning-exercise and fun project for whoever wants to get involved, and to foster a better understanding of how Beta Minecraft works. This project doesn't need to be finished overnight in a half-broken state that nobody understands.
