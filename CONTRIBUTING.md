# Contributing
Simply fork the [`main` branch](https://github.com/OfficialPixelBrush/BetrockPlusPlus/tree/main) and commit whatever changes you want to make.

Ensure your fork is up-to-date with the `main` branch, then make a pull request.

## AI policy

Generally, we're perfectly fine with adding code that was created with the help of AI tooling to our codebase.

What we *don't* want are slop-commits that just rewrite stuff for the sake of rewriting it. We don't want or need a 505k line mega-commit that adds 26 new files, that all have duplicated functionality, or break other parts of the code.

Keep it reasonable, don't overdo it. This is supposed to be a learning-exercise and fun project for whoever wants to get involved, and to foster a better understanding of how Beta Minecraft works. This project doesn't need to be finished overnight in a half-broken state that nobody understands.

## Development
Grab the `main` branch for the most up-to-date, albeit unstable, repository.

## Recommended VSCode Extensions
- `clangd` (ideally `clangd-22` for Doxygen comment integration). Also used as formatter.
- CMake Tools
- Doxygen Documentation Generator

## Style Guide
- Use types that guarantee a known bit-width (i.e. `int32_t`, `int16_t` or `int8_t`)
- Make use of existing functionality. Don't reinvent the wheel. Use enums, defines, custom types and classes for consistency, please.
- Enums **must** have a type
- If possible, do not pass values separately. Make use of structs that combine them
    - i.e. instead of `int32_t posX, int32_t posY, int32_t posZ`, just use `Int3 pos`
- Run `clang-format -i` over the files you changed
- Provide a short description what a file is for the relevant file, why it exists and what its used for
- PLEASE include the copyright notice at the top. This also serves as a nice way for people to get credited, if the git history is ever lost. **Any** change will get you added to there (within reason).
